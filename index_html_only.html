        <p>I'm Akshay Dhamsania, and Dallas, Texas is where I'm from. I am a rising senior at Texas A&M University, and my academic 
            path has been molded by my strong interest in computer science and statistics minor. As a research scientist and professor in the fields of statistics and cybersecurity, 
            I see myself leading the way in academia and research over the next ten years. Beyond the classroom, technology is something I'm passionate about. As a frequent contributor to 
            open-source software platforms, this endeavor has improved my technical proficiency and encouraged creativity and teamwork.</p>
